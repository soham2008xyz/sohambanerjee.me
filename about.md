## Hi. I'm Soham.

I'm an engineer by education and an entrepreneur by vocation. I'm at times a dreamer and at times a doer, albeit not always in that order. I'm on the wrong side of 23, and currently residing in the City of Joy.

My day job includes being the resident jack-of-all-trades at [Renderbit Technologies](https://renderbit.com) and [OneWalletHub](https://onewallethub.com), and all the responsibility-juggling associated with running two startups. (Shameless self promotion - we do really cool stuff, you should check us out!)

When I'm not tinkering with all things tech, you can find me curled up in a corner with a book and a cup of coffee. I play the occassional Counter Strike game, and in case it's not obvious yet,  I blog. Topics range from a deep dive into how the Ethereum blockchain works, to deep philosophical rants on anything under the sun.

Now for the legalese. All views expressed here are solely my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of any organization whatsoever with which I have been in the past, am presently or will be affiliated in the future.

Alright, enough talk. How about you check out a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/soham_banerjee/playlist/2ze0SJ3efrF2jSBWuLXX8k?si=2eDzoFYUT3qtN8kkpdUhuw) of my favourite tunes on Spotify?
