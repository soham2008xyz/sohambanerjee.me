Every time someone leaves, they take with them a piece of you. And leave behind a hollow you, a void that you learn to unsee with time, but a void nonetheless.

Living with the fact that it’s over is the hardest.

People you once loved with all your heart, people you thought you couldn’t live without, are now just faint memories and blurred faces.
