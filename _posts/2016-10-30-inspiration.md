We spend our life in search of inspiration. But inspiration is not something that adheres to a schedule, or a deadline, or a timeframe. Inspiration is that idea gnawing at the back of your head at three am in the morning, which makes you push back the sheets, climb out from your bed and start tapping away at your keyboard (or, in this case, my smartphone). But bear with me before the inevitable question, “Why the (unwanted) midnight sermon?” pops up in your minds.

While much has been said and written about the importance of inspiration in the cycle of creation, what many have glossed over is, inspiration is not a one-time occurrence. It's not the flash of a far-forgotten idea you might have had once. Inspiration is the fuel that keeps you going beyond the point where mind and body scream for you to stop. And like any fuel, it runs out. In fact, inspiration is one of the most perishable commodities ever. While all of this might sound arcane to you right now, pause for a moment and consider, what would remain in our lives but the drudgery of daily routine, once inspiration is done away with? I mean, why would you get out of bed in the morning? Sure, the alarm would buzz, and you would have places to go to, but seriously, how many times have you jumped up with excitement at the prospect of visiting the same office (or school, or college) daily, instead of crawling into the covers for five more minutes? (If you have, congratulations! Finally someone is doing something right with their life).

So, next time you feel yourselves overwhelmed by monotony - take a break, go out and inspire yourselves. And do this as often as you can. By the way, inspiration does not always have to be the next-big-thing, or a cure for cancer - inspiration can be found in the smallest of places and things. And once you've finally found something that makes you tick, make sure you never let that go. (Yeah, I know, easier said than done, right?)

> "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it."
