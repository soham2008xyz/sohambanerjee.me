Come the last few weeks of December every year and we are faced with a deluge of “new year resolutions” - promises to keep and targets to attain in the upcoming three hundred and sixty five days or so. The utility or veracity of such resolutions is often questioned, especially as they have the dubious distinction of being relegated to the very bottom of our to-do lists as the year progress. Many dismiss the entire concept altogether as junk.

Be as it may, I would rather envision these as kind of a summary of all that we have learnt and imbibed over the last year, with all its ups and downs. In this aspect, here are some of my own “resolutions” (so to speak) for the upcoming year, in no particular order.

1. I will not book an Uber if I can walk the same distance. #WalkBeforeIRide
2. I will delegate and allocate responsibilities instead of micromanaging people.
3. I will read a new book every week.
4. I will learn sales and marketing from the ground up.
5. I will meditate for 30 minutes every day.

I am not sure how many I will be able to check off, but hey - always good to have a checklist, right?

Here’s hoping the new year brings fruition to all your wishes and aspirations. Happy New Year, everyone!
