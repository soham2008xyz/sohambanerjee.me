excerpt:
  Whatever happened to long-form prose? In this era of social media, where status updates and 140-character tweets dominate our attention spans, the art of writing at length seems to be fading into obscurity. It's a trend that's been happening for years, as brevity has become the preferred mode of communication in the digital age. In a world where we are constantly bombarded with information and distractions, it's no wonder that we have little time or patience for long-form writing. We have become accustomed to quick and easy information, and the idea of sitting down to read a novel or a lengthy essay can seem daunting. But in our rush to consume information in bite-sized pieces, we are losing something important. We are losing the ability to immerse ourselves in a story, to become fully invested in a character's journey, or to explore complex ideas in depth.

In a world where we are constantly bombarded with information and distractions, it's no wonder that we have little time or patience for long-form writing. We have become accustomed to quick and easy information, and the idea of sitting down to read a novel or a lengthy essay can seem daunting.

But in our rush to consume information in bite-sized pieces, we are losing something important. We are losing the ability to immerse ourselves in a story, to become fully invested in a character's journey, or to explore complex ideas in depth.

Long-form prose is a romantic art, one that requires time and patience. It invites us to slow down, to take a deep breath, and to savor the words on the page. But in our fast-paced world, we have no time to stand and stare.

We have become so accustomed to scrolling through our feeds, skimming headlines, and clicking on links, that we have forgotten how to appreciate the power of language. We have forgotten how to get lost in a book or an essay, to be transported to another time or place, or to see the world through someone else's eyes.

It's time to reclaim the art of long-form prose. It's time to embrace the power of language and to appreciate the beauty of a well-crafted sentence. Let's slow down, take a deep breath, and immerse ourselves in the written word. Let's rediscover the romance of long-form writing and remember what it means to truly engage with a piece of literature.
