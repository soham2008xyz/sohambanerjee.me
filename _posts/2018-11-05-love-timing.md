excerpt:
  When Love finds you, it's seldom at your best. Rather, it happens upon you at your worst - when you've lost all faith in yourself and your confidence lies tattered in a thousand scraps. It finds you to patiently put those pieces back, one after the other, painstakingly. It finds you to teach you to love again. It finds you in spite of all the walls you build up over time. It finds you despite all the odds stacked up against it. And once it finds you, it stays - asking but for nought in return.

When Love finds you, it's seldom at your best.

Rather, it happens upon you at your worst - when you've lost all faith in yourself and your confidence lies tattered in a thousand scraps.

It finds you to patiently put those pieces back, one after the other, painstakingly. It finds you to teach you to love again. It finds you in spite of all the walls you build up over time. It finds you despite all the odds stacked up against it. And once it finds you, it stays - asking but for nought in return.

But once it finds you, it deserves to see a brilliant sunset after a hand-in-hand hike in the mountains. It deserves a warm hug and a kiss. And it deserves to be around for many such more sunsets to follow.
